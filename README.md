# Insurance_Regression_Prediction
The project provides a Regression on the Insurance Prediction Data which shows the features of individuals, tuned using Ridge &amp; Lasso.

# Consider the data present in the Insurance dataset file.
Following is the attribute related information:

age: age of primary beneficiary<br>
sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male<br>
bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9<br>
children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents<br>
smoker: Smoking, yes or no<br>
region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.<br>
charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance<br>


# Problem statement: 
To predict the approximate insurance cost based upon the rest of the features provided for each individual.

# Outcome:
It predicts the approximate insurance cost based upon the features provided for each individual. It is a Regression problem. The algorithm used in this project is Linear Regression. Executed the steps like Data preprocessing, Feature selection, Model Building, Evaluation & Tuning.

# Conclusion
Performed Base Linear Regression and Tuned using Ridge & Lasso Techniques. Out of Both, Ridge is giving the lowest RMSE (0.48) and R-Squared (0.709), Adj-R Squared (0.709) are Closed to each other.
